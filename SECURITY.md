# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
This starter is a template repository. Define supported release branches/tags when your product ships.

Please include:
- Description and impact
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected files/components
- Any proof-of-concept details

## Secure Development Rules
- Never commit secrets or credentials.
- Prefer short-lived credentials and environment variables.
- Review dependency and CI warnings before merge.
