# Customer Feedback Backlog

Use this file as the source for the `agent-issue-proposals` workflow.

Rules:
- Keep each feedback signal as a bullet `- <feedback>`.
- Keep entries concrete and user-observable.
- Include direct phrasing when possible.
- Only items under `## Signals` are parsed by automation.

## Signals
- Users want faster project filtering by status.
- Users asked for CSV export in project lists.
